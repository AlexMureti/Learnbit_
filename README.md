# LearnBit: AI-Powered Coding Tutor 🚀

## About
LearnBit is a simple AI-powered coding assistant built to help beginner programmers.  
It gives **real-time feedback** on code, answers beginner-friendly coding questions,  
and tracks progress — like having a **personal mentor**.

## Problem
- Too many scattered tutorials → wasted study hours.  
- Students wait too long for feedback when stuck.  
- Repeated mistakes due to lack of progress tracking.  
- Tutors can’t give personalized attention to every learner.

LearnBit solves these by:  
- **Code Feedback** → Type code, get AI suggestions.  
- **Interactive Q&A** → Ask coding questions, get clear answers.  
- **Progress Tracker** → Track coding tasks with a history log.  
- **Speech** → AI reads feedback out loud.  
- **Flexible Models** → Works with Hugging Face or offline DeepSeek.

## Features
- Real-time AI code review  
- Beginner-friendly answers to coding questions  
- Progress list stored locally  
- Text-to-speech feedback  
- Switchable AI model support  

---
